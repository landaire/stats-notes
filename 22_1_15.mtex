# General Notes

Covering everything (including yesterday -- wtf dawg)

## Reviewing the last quiz

$$ P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B) $$

$$ P(C'|A\cap B) = 1 - P(C | A \cap B)$$

$$ P(A \cap B \cap C') = P(A \cap B) \cap C') $$

## Some other assignment

G = get a job
T = two interviews

$$ P(G) = .6 $$
$$ P(T | G) = .75 $$
$$ P(T | G') = .45 $$

Use a tree for this shit
