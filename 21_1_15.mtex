$$ P(H_1) = .8 $$
$$ P(H_2 | H_1) = .7 $$
$$ P(H_2 | H'_1) = .9 $$
$$ P(H_1 \cap H_2) = ? $$
$$ P((H_1 \cap H'_2) \cup (H'_1 \cap H_2)) = ? $$

What is the probability of hitting the second basket?

Can only hit the second basket:

- After hitting the first
- After missing the first

$$ P(H_2) = P((H_1 \cap H_2) \cup (H'_1 \cap H_2)) = ? $$
$$ = P(H_1 \cap H_2) + P(H'_1 \cap H_2) = ? $$
$$ = .56 + .18 $$ (based off of the tree that was built)
