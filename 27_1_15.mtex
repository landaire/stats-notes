# A lion, a tiger, and a bear are randomly selected

.1 is the probability that the lion is coward
.2 that the tiger is cowardly
.3 that the bear is cowardly

Assume that there is no influence involving the cowardice of more than one of these animals.

What is the probability that all three are cowardly?

$$ P(L \cap T \cap B) = P(L)P(T)P(B) = (.1)(.2)(.3) = (.006) $$
